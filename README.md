# Solana Wallet Cross-Platform App with Expo, Web3 & React Native

This is a simple Solana Wallet Cross-Platform App built with Expo, Web3 & React Native to learn about web3 and smart contract. The Solana Wallet is an essential bridge connecting DeFi developers and the Solana blockchain. With Solana's quick and low-cost transactions.

## Screens and Features

### Welcome

These screens show using the Biometric Prompt (Android) or FaceID and TouchID (iOS) to authenticate the user with a fingerprint or face scan. Later,automatically create mnemonic phrase or recovery wallet with mnemonic phrase. Save and load mnemonics from local securely store on the device.

### Dashboard

These screens shows the accounts SOL/SPL-token balances,SOL/SPL-token deposits, SOL/SPL-token transfers. Camera support with QR code scanning for Sol/SPL-token deposit, transfer. Multiple wallet accounts add,delete,refresh.

### Safe Transfer
Build the "Safe Token Transfer app", that prevents funds from being lost.
When someone wants to transfer tokens to a particular user, they do it in 2 steps to enforce safety. First, they deposit those tokens into an escrow token account that is controlled by our program. Second, the final receiver of the tokens confirms the withdrawal and receives the funds from the escrow.
If they fat-fingered receiver's address, or if receiver cannot find his keys anymore, they can safely pull back his Safe Payment before the transfer is complete.This smart contract repository:https://github.com/linktel0/safe-transfer.git

</div>


### Safe Exchange
Introduce a third party C which both A and B trust.A or B can go first and send their token to C. C then waits for the other party to send their token and only then does C release both token.The blockchain way is to replace the trusted third party C with code on a blockchain, specifically a smart contract that verifiably acts the same way a
trusted third party would. This smart contract repository:

#### Request Airdrop

This app is configured to connect to dev network so the tokens showed are not real.
Good thing is that every time you press here you get 2 SOL in your account that can be used to test the app, make transfers...


## What I used to build this Solana Wallet

### Expo
Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.
 - [Expo](https://expo.io/)


### Solana/web3.js
This is the Solana Javascript API built on the Solana JSON RPC API.
 - [Solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)

### React Native Paper
Paper is a collection of customizable and production-ready components for React Native, following Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines.
 - [React Native Paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)

### React Navigation
Routing and navigation for Expo and React Native apps.
 - [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

### Tailwind CSS
NativeWind uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native
- [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev//)

### More

Moreover I used other libraries for crypto, qr generate and scan...

You can check them in [package.json](https://github.com/linktel0/solanaWallet/blob/main/package.json)

## Problems that I found and workarounds to solve them

### Crypto dependency

`solana/web3.js` needs `Crypto` that it seems that now it's included in NodeJS but no in React Native and although I found some ways to have it working in React Native I didn't find a way to do it without ejecting the app from Expo.

Finally I found a workaround that basically uses `ethers.js` and `expo-random` to be able to generate mnemonic and seed. Later, I was able to use `solana/web3.js` without issues to connect to the network, get balance, transfer...


## Final
My goal with this was to learn the Web3 basics building something simple and sharing 100% of the code between Web and Native.

I think it has been a good introduction to see how Web3 works.


## Run it:

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/linktel0/solanaWallet.git
$ cd solanaWallet
$ yarn 
$ expo web or expo start
~~~

Or install apk for Android:
